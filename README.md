# Hello.

Xing Ern here. I just completed the 9-week Web Development Bootcamp by Le Wagon. Check out the apps that my team developed: 1) [A Taste of Home](https://github.com/f-Xiaoxi/a-taste-of-home); and 2) [Take Trails](https://github.com/barbayjuliette/take_trails). They're by no means perfect, but I'm still quite proud of them.

I'm currently looking for a job in software development. In the meantime, I will be learning as much as I can! Currently, I'm focusing on React.js and some computer science fundamentals. You might see some of my mini projects on here.
