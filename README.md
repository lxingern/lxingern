# Hello.

Xing Ern here. I'm currently trying to transition into a career in software development - I completed the 9-week Web Development Bootcamp by Le Wagon in Dec 2022 and the 8-week Graduate Software Developer Program by Wiley Edge in Jun 2023. Check out the apps that I/my team developed in the pinned repos below. They're by no means perfect, but I'm still quite proud of them.

While continuing to look for a job in software development, I will be learning as much as I can! Currently, I'm focusing on Linux and some DevOps stuff. You might see some of my mini projects on here.
