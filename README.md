# Hello.

Xing Ern here. I just completed the 9-week Web Development Bootcamp by Le Wagon. Check out the apps that my team developed: 1) [A Taste of Home](https://github.com/f-Xiaoxi/a-taste-of-home); and 2) [Take Trails](https://github.com/barbayjuliette/take_trails). I'm quite proud of them.

I'm currently looking for a job in software development. In the meantime, I will be learning as much as I can! Currently, I'm focusing on Node.js. You might see some of my mini projects on here.

Reach me at lxingern@gmail.com if you wanna connect.
